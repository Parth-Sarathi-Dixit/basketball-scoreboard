# basketball-scoreboard
An interactive basketball scoreboard
Hello everyone!
This is my second project based on basic html css and javascript. This is similar to the first project i.e., it is a counter but I have added additional buttons to increment count by 1, 2 and 3. 
The code is a bit raw because I do not have much experience of javascript now.
Hope you will enjoy the app... :)
